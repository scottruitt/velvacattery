He is also featured in two pictures in the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y67g46" title="San Francisco Chronicle article">San Francisco Chronicle article</a> about the event. </p>
				<p>Judge Rachel Anger had this to say about Ray: </p>
				<blockquote>As an exhibitor, I would have dreams about walking up and reaching out for my best cat... As a judge, we look at it from a little different perspective. We want a cat that says here I am... Once and a while one comes along and they show themselves and they just make my job easy. This guy did that for me... I saw everything I wanted to see. A beautiful Russian Blue, elegant in a much different way than the Orientals. He has a beautifully elegant body, well-muscled, great muscle tone, a fabulous coat that has a density to it that adds to the body structure. His tail matches the form of him. And a must-have item are deep green eyes, he has good eye color, darling ears that are set as much aside the head as the top... It&rsquo;s just all there. </blockquote>
